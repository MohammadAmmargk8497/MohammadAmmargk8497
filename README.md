<h2 align="center">Hi there :wave: !</h2>

Hey, I am Ammar a Deep Learning enthusiast with a keen interest in Robotics. I am an avid reader, a lost researcher and a technology preacher. This is how much I know myself, I may be more than what I am; waiting to be discovered. My journey through the undergrad though tempestuous has shaped me into a better self, a person of responsibilities, a keen listener and an observer. My infatuation with technology stems from the childhood memories of my father sharing with me seemingly magical breakthroughs in science. As I grew up, this affinity towards technology found new heights, culminating in my desicion to pursue Computer Enginnering. My Github page is the reflection of my journey as a student programmer, with each repository better than the one before.
